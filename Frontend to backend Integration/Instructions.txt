1) first Run the backend code in intellij or sts
2) then ng serve the frontend ..by oeneing the cmd inside frontend folder
3) Add or post the products by giving the id,etc
4) for deleting we give the id
5) similarly we execute or check for other methods


It even have the security part implemented..
i.e we created token component adn token service
6) When opened and want to see the security...first give foo and foo for username and password 
7) Make sure the jwt code is running
8) Now press authenticate button
9) then click greet or admin buttons and check in inspect
U can see a jwt token gets generated ....after we click authentciate button

No need of any project or all projects to be in same folder..as we are using localhost url's for accesing


There in github ...github wasnt able to take the files so deleted the node modules(22k files) ..so if u want it to work ..make sure u do 
npm update...to install all npm modules

but be careful as the angular version u have ..and the cloned code version is different then u r code wont work as functionalities of modules gets changed in new versions
